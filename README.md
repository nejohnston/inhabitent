## Project Summary

The Inhabitent Project was used as an introduction to the content managing system that is WordPress.

## Languages

MAMP, PHP, WordPress, Javascript, HTML, CSS

## Personal Learning

Personal learnings were a basic understanding of PHP and its relationship with WordPress. By this I mean
using a framework given to us as a starter, then building upon and customizing Inhabitent's theme.

I quite enjoyed this project's challenge. The main thing I took away from this project was the importance
of specificity, most importantly the nesting of classes and elements in the unique tag that WordPress gives
you.


## Improvements

Improvements to this site would be perfecting the css. Furthermore, would be nice to perfect my css'
syntax in regards to my nesting.
